I found a Heart Disease dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/heart-disease) and plan on implementing a variety of machine learning models for the prediction of heart disease using this dataset.

As of 1/15/25, I have implemented KNN for this purpose and have uploaded those files to this repository. 
The files uploaded are 
  the python file where I implemented the KNN model, 
  figures produced in the code to help decision making and understand the model,
  a excel file with the evaluation metrics compiled,
  and a text file describing the figures that were generated.
The KNN model was not that great with an accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score sitting around 0.5 (exact values can be seen in ML_Model_Scores.xlsx)
