I found a Heart Disease dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/heart-disease) and plan on implementing a variety of machine learning models for the prediction of heart disease using this dataset.

As of 1/15/25, I have implemented KNN for this purpose and have uploaded those files to this repository. 
The files uploaded are 
  the python file where I implemented the KNN model, 
  figures produced in the code to help decision making and understand the model,
  a excel file with the evaluation metrics compiled,
  and a text file describing the figures that were generated.
The KNN model was not that great with an accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score sitting around 0.5 (exact values can be seen in ML_Model_Scores.xlsx)

As of 3/23/25, I have implemented decision tree as well and uploaded the files.
The files uploaded are
  the python file with the decision tree implemented
  figures showing the produced decision tree
  an updated excel file
  and a text file describing the figures.
The decision tree was not great either. Accuracy, precision, and f1 were sitting around 0.5 but recall jumped to 0.7 which was cool.

As of 4/8/25, I have implemented random forest.
i just uploaded a
  python file and an update excel file
Random forest was kind of the worst one so far. low 0.5 scores and even in the 0.4 range at some point.
